# Lab 0: Environment, Python, and GitHub!

## Part 0

If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to www.github.com to
create one.  I recommend using your Cal Poly user name, but you may use
another user name.  Check out (clone) the code in the lab0 repository.
See the essential Github commands and link to a GitHub tutorial on the
PolyLearn page.

## Part 1

In the plantets.py file, add code to implement the functionality shown by the following sample run:

#### Sample Run:

```
What do you weigh on earth? 136

On Mars you would weigh 51.68 pounds.
On Jupiter you would weigh 318.24 pounds.
```

#### Important Information and Requirements:

- To calculate a person&#39;s weight on Mars, multiply their weight on
  earth by 0.38.
- To calculate a person&#39;s weight on Jupiter, multiply their weight
  on earth by 2.34.
- Your output must match my sample output exactly. Make sure there is a
  blank line in between prompting for the user&#39;s weight and
  displaying the results.
- Your program may use a &quot;cast&quot; only one time. Ask me if you
  don&#39;t know what this means.
- Your program may only use the print function once.
- Run the unit tests in planets_tests.py to check your solution!

### Submission/Grading

Make sure that the code that you want to be graded has been committed
*and pushed* to GitHub.  Failure to do so will result in receiving no
credit for the lab.  Not sure if you code has been pushed to GitHub?
Use a web browser, go to you GitHub account and check!  Once your
assignment has been graded, feedback will be automatically emailed to
you.

### IDE

If you want to use an IDE, you are welcome to. If you do not already have an IDE that you are familiar with, PyCharm is a good choice for Python development.

## For folks new to Cal Poly: Unix Environment

### Unix

The lab machines run a distribution of the Linux operating system. For
simplicity, and to gain experience in a, potentially, new environment,
we will do our coursework in this environment.

Open a terminal window. To do so, from the system menu on the desktop toolbar,

select **Applications** → **System Tools** → **Terminal**. The Terminal
program will present a window with a command-line prompt. At this prompt
you can type Linux commands to list files, move files, create
directories, etc. For this lab you will use only a few
commands. Additional commands can be found at:

- Unix Tutorial
  -
    - [Tutorials 1 &amp;](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)[2](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
    - [Parts](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/%7Ekevin/unix-tutorial/toc.html)[1-5](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/%7Ekevin/unix-tutorial/toc.html)
- Editors
  -
    - [emacs](http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs.html)[tutorial](http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs.html)
    - [vi](http://www.unix-manuals.com/tutorials/vi/vi-in-10-1.html)[tutorial](http://www.unix-manuals.com/tutorials/vi/vi-in-10-1.html)

In the terminal, type `ls` at the prompt and hit \&lt;Enter\&gt;. This
command will list the files in the current directory. (also know as a
folder.) If you type `pwd` , the current directory will be printed (it
is often helpful to type `pwd` while you are navigating directories). If
you type `tree` , then you will see a tree-like listing of the
directory structure rooted at the current directory.

Create a new directory for your coursework by typing `mkdir cpe202`.
Use `ls` again to see that the new directory has been created.

Change into this new directory with `cd` by typing `cd cpe202` . To move
back &quot;up&quot; one directory, type `cd ..`. To summarize

- `ls` list files in the currentdirectory
- `cd` change to anotherdirectory
- `mkdir` create a newdirectory
- `pwd` print (the path of) the currentdirectory

Though these basic commands are enough for now, consider working through a Unix tutorial.

### Editing

There are many options for editing a Python program. On the department
machines, you will find emacs, vi, nano, gedit, sublime, and
others. The editor that one uses is often a matter of taste. You are not
required to use a specific editor, but we will offer some advice (and we
will try to help with whichever one you choose). There is lots more
information here:

[http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~akeen/courses/csc101/handouts/labs/lab1.html](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Eakeen/courses/csc101/handouts/labs/lab1.html)

### **Interactive Interpreter**

The Python interpreter can be used in an interactive mode. In this mode,
you will be able to type a statement and immediately see the result of
its execution. Interactive mode is very useful for experimenting with
the language and for testing small pieces of code, but your general
development process with be editing and executing a file as discussed
previously.

Start the interpreter in interactive mode by typing `python` at the
command prompt. You should now see something like the following.

```
Python 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 07:18:10) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32


Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>>
```

The `>>>` is the interpreter&#39;s prompt. You can type an expression at
the prompt to see what it evaluates to. Type each of the following (hit
enter after each one) to see the result. When you are finished, you can
exit the interpreter by typing ctrl-D (i.e., hold the control key and
hit d).

- `0 +1`
- `2 \* 2`
- `19 // 3`
- `19 / 3`
- `19 / 3.0`
- `0 // 3.0`
- `4 \* 2 + 27 // 3 +4`
- `4 \* (2 + 27) // 3 +4`
